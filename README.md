# Animated game simulation

This is my simulation project in javafx and scenebuilder<br/>
The jar also included to the files

## Description

There is a ball which bouncing and can broke the bricks<br/>
To bounce the ball itself used the timeline operator and its traectory with x,y<br/>

And there are classes to create bricks and <br/>
check collision with bricks and change the traectory after that<br/>
and some other features
